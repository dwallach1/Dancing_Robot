# Dancing_Robot

This project uses HTML5 and WebGL to make 2D and 3D interactive shapes. There are user instructions on how to use the program that can be printed on the HTML webpage by pressing the "h" key. Also, if you open the console on your web terminal, information about the inner workings of the program will be printed continuously
